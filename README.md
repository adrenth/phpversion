# PhpVersion

This is a very tiny Mac OS application which adds your current running local PHP version to the Mac OS status bar.

This small apps works perfectly if you have installed PHP with `brew`. The command `/usr/local/bin/php -v` is used to determine the version. Only the `major`.`minor` version will be showed e.g `7.0`, `7.1`.
